# pglife
This website was designed and developed by me during my 8-week internship training with Internshala Trainings during summer of 2022. You can view their full training course <a href="https://trainings.internshala.com/web-development-course/" target="_blank">here</a>.

I utilized my learnings from the training provided by them into developing solution to a problem I have seen alot in my university.


PGLife is a locally hosted website to allow outstation students to find housing in the form of hostels, dormitories or paying guests.

The website provides with a basic location shortlisting search for accomodations in respective cities and regions. To add on to it's functionalities, it allows you to create an account with your data so the website can help you with the shortlisting. It even allows you to like certain PGs to add them to your interested properties to review in the future.
